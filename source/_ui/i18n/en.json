  "Use this tool to scrape and import Mustache templates and JSON data files from actual web pages, preferably the actual backend CMS that Fepper is prototyping for. Simply enter the URL of the page you wish to scrape. Then, enter the CSS selector you wish to target (prepended with &quot;#&quot; for IDs and &quot;.&quot; for classes). Classnames and tagnames may be appended with array index notation ([n]). Otherwise, the Scraper will scrape all elements of that class or tag sequentially. Such a loosely targeted scrape will save many of the targeted fields to the JSON file, but will only save the first instance of the target to a Mustache template.":
