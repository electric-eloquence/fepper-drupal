If you change the configuration system to use file storage instead of the database for the active Drupal site configuration, this directory will contain the active configuration. By default, this directory will be empty. If you are using files to store the active configuration, and you want to move it between environments, files from this directory should be placed in the staging directory on the target server. To make this configuration active, visit admin/config/development/configuration/sync on the target server. For information about deploying configuration between servers, see https://www.drupal.org/documentation/administer/config
