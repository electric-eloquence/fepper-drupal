# Fepper theme for Drupal

The Fepper theme for Drupal includes templates generated by the Fepper frontend 
prototyper as well as styles, scripts, and theme functions which build out the 
Drupal theme to match the look and feel of the Fepper frontend.

* For a full description of Fepper for Drupal, visit the 
  [project page](https://github.com/electric-eloquence/fepper-drupal).

## Requirements

* No special requirements

## Installation

* You may install this as you would normally 
  [install a contributed Drupal theme](https://www.drupal.org/getting-started/install-contrib/themes). 
* However, it is highly recommended to use this theme with a complete Fepper 
  prototyper.
* With that being known, it should also be known that this theme is included 
  within a fully configured Drupal 8 backend in the 
  [Fepper for Drupal project](https://github.com/electric-eloquence/fepper-drupal).
* This theme is unopinionated with regards to styles and markup and should be 
  used as a 
  [base theme](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/theming-drupal-8/creating-a-drupal-8-sub-theme-or-sub-theme-of-sub-theme).
  You are encouraged to override any or all aspects of this theme for your 
  custom needs.
* However, if you wish to replicate the look and feel of the Fepper demo site 
  ([as per the screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/electric-eloquence/fepper-drupal/dev/backend/drupal/themes/fepper/screenshot.png)), 
  you should follow the Fepper documentation on 
  [importing the sample Drupal backend](https://github.com/electric-eloquence/fepper-drupal#user-content-drupal-install) 
  mentioned earlier. This will serve as a starting point for further 
  customization.

## Configuration

The theme has no menu or administerable settings.
